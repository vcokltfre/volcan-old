# Volcan

Volcan is a powerful, extensible moderation bot for Discord.

## Why another bot?

Many moderations bots already exist for Discord, some of them - for example Zeppelin - are already incredibly complex and fill the needs of the majority of servers, so why build another bot? It mainly boils down to a personal issue I have with the existing solutions, combined they have (almost) everything I want, but individually they don't.

Here's the criteria for my perfect moderation bot, and what Volcan hopes to achieve:

- Powerfull shell-like command interface. (`ban @vcokltfre --days 3 --no-dm`)
- Easy to customise commands, such as aliasing commands in a config file.
- Feature-complete API for extensibility, with identical functionality to commands.
- WebSocket event stream for bot actions.
